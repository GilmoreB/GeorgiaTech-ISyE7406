The purpose of this homework is to help you to be prepared to analyze datasets in your future studies and
career. Since we are learning how to analyze the dataset, this HW (and other early HWs) will provide the
detailed R codes and technical details. Hence, besides running these R codes or their extensions, we expect
you to write your homework solution in the format of a report (in pdf or word) that summarizes your finndings,
understandings, and interpretations. In the main body of the report, please be concise (possibly 2 - 8 pages) and
easy-understanding, e.g., using the descriptive tables/figures to summarize your results (instead of blindly copying
and pasting R/Python output. Of course, if you want, please feel free to include R or python codes/outputs as
an appendix (as many pages as you want).

Problem (KNN). Consider the well-known zipcode data set in the machine learning and data mining literature,
which are available from the book website: <www-stat.stanford.edu/ElemStatLearn>.
