**Linear Regression in R/Rstudio:** Consider the data set "fat" in the "faraway" library of
R. The purpose of this homework is to help you better understand linear regression and R/Rstudio. Here we
assume that the percentage of body fat using Brozek's equation (brozek, the first column) as the response
variable, and the other 17 variables as potential predictors. We will use several different statistical methods
to fit this dataset in the problem of predicting brozek using the other 17 potential predictors. For that
purpose, it is useful to split it into the following sub-tasks.

The dataset fat has 252 observations and 18 variables, and, for more detailed description, see the link
(http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/faraway/faraway.pdf) (page #37).
